##monero-wallet-cli-wrapper

Quick python wrapper around monero-wallet-cli binary  
Using asyncio and subprocess  

- first task "pro" restores a wallet using it's seed from specific height of your choice  
- Second task "pro2" runs command of your choice like sweep_all  
  check out offical docs for more commands
- Don't use the bin from this repo if you don't trust me get your own from offical repo
- if you are running this on a cloud server don't download the offical tarball containing the bins some of them is detected as malware

you can see random `print()` they act as break points so you can debug where it stopped  

here's a sample output:  

```bash

```
